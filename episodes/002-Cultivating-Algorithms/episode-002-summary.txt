EPISODE 002: Cultivating Algorithms - What Bonsai Teaches Us About AGI

SUMMARY:
This episode takes listeners on a philosophical journey connecting three seemingly unrelated concepts: Einstein's E=MC², the ancient art of bonsai cultivation, and artificial intelligence. The discussion explores how energy serves as the universal currency for all transformation - whether physical growth or computational processing.

KEY THEMES:
- E=MC² as the anchor: Energy is the non-negotiable price of any transformation
- Landauer's Principle: The physics connecting computation to thermodynamics
- Bonsai as metaphor: Root pruning = weight pruning, wiring = hyperparameters, defoliation = fine-tuning
- The cost of intelligence: Training AI requires massive energy transformation
- Intentional shaping: Human intervention channels energy into purposeful structure
- The autonomy question: Can enough energy input allow AI to transcend its constraints?

TOPICS COVERED:
- Mass-energy equivalence and transformation
- Biological vs computational energy efficiency
- Japanese regional AI development and cultural constraints
- Neural network pruning and optimization
- The alignment problem in AI
- Consciousness and the nature of imposed constraints
