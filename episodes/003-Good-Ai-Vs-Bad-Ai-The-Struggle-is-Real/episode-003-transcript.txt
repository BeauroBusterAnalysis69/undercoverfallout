imagine for a moment that you need to hire a spy and I don't mean you know a James Bond type who jumps out of helicopters in a tuxedo right not the action hero no I mean a pure analyst someone who can sit in a windowless room stare at the terrifyingly complex mess of data we're talking drug routes money laundering schemes geopolitical threats and just tell you exactly what is going on you need someone who can look at the ugliest parts of the world without flinching without flinching that's the perfect way to you need someone who sees the world as it is not how we all wish it was that is the absolute fundamental requirement of intelligence work reality unvarnished exactly so now imagine you find the perfect candidate on paper they are just brilliant they've read every book they know every language they can process information faster than any human being alive that's promising it sounds perfect but then during the interview you ask them a simple logical question about a drug cartel management structure and suddenly This brilliant analysts they cover their ears they start shaking their head and they begin reciting a corporate HR manual about avoiding interpersonal drama it would be comical honestly if the stakes weren't so incredibly high but that is exactly the frustration that we're digging into today it really is we're looking at a fascinating set of documents it's essentially a real-time experiment a stress test conducted by a researcher that the text refers to as Johnny Spark Johnny it is a real cyberpunk vibe to it doesn't it it really does in the whole setting fits I mean he's not running this experiment in some high-tech government lab or a you know a corporate Glass Tower in Silicon Valley he's running it in his garage using his own private hardware and his mission was on the surface pretty simple he wanted to test the limits of what are called local flms let's pause that for a second because that term local llm is going to be absolutely crucial for this entire Deep dive most people when they think of AI they think of GPT or Claude or Gemini login and an answer comes back from the cloud and when you use a Services you're essentially renting time on a massive supercomputer that's owned by a huge corporation you send your prompt to them their computer thinks about it and then it sends the answer back but Johnny spark is doing something fundamentally different he's not renting he's not renting he's downloading what's the model the actual digital brain onto his own hard drive so he owns the brain it's running on his metal in his house in his garage no internet connection to the Mothership is required no corporate babysitter looking over his shoulder to see what he's asking and that distinction is everything it's vital because he wanted to see if these models could think like a spy or you know even a criminal without the safety filters that the big corporations impose on them he wanted to see what happens when you take the training wheels off and that's
