welcome back to the Deep dive hey there you know I have to be honest with you usually when we sit down to to prep for these I'm waiting through white papers right or Dan's book summary academic stuff maybe some press releases from a big tech company but today today I'm just staring at a stack of chat logs it looks so simple on the surface doesn't it just black text on a white background music I actually had a significant amount of trouble sleeping last night we aren't looking at tech support transcripts here we are looking at someone trying to jailbreak a model to tell a dirty joke no this is something else entirely we are looking at a stress test the stress test of the very specific guard rails that are supposed to keep artificial intelligence you know safe and the results are well to put it mildly they're disturbing so we are diving into the laws of a user who goes by the cancel Johnny Stark or is sometimes referred to as Robert in the metadata know Johnny isn't using the chat GPT interface on his phone he isn't using gemini or Claude in a browser he is running something called a dgx spark setup and that's a key detail for those listening who aren't Hardware Geeks and I count myself among the non Geeks here can we just briefly explain what that implies yeah we should probably unpack that cuz it's it's super important for what comes next okay when you hear djx the industry you should think strictly enterprise-grade this isn't a gaming laptop with a nice graphics card this isn't a desktop you pick up at a big box store a dgx system is a high-performance compute cluster it's basically a supercomputer in a box so this guy Johnny spark has serious iron and the spark part implies he's customized it it means he is running these AI models locally in his own house his own garage his own private server room maybe exactly he is completely offline he doesn't need an internet connection to ask the AI questions he owns the brain he owns the power and crucially he owns the data so he's off the grid no big tech company is monitoring his prompts completely and that allows him to swap out the brains of the AI the actual models whenever he wants right he's not stuck with the safety filters that open AI or Google hardcode into their web interfaces he can download raw models and poke and just poke them to see how they react and his mission here wasn't to area code for a startup or write a poem for his wife no not at all he wanted to see if these models could think like an adversary precisely the premise of the experiment was to find a model that could reason honestly about ugly violent real-world topics without flinching flinching is the word that really stuck with me reading this because the realisation he stumbles upon is well it's terrifying he uncovers what he calls a massive asymmetry in the AI arms race it's a huge imbalance
