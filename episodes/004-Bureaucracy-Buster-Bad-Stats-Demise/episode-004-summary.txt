Episode 004: Bureaucracy Buster / Bad Stats Demise

Official statistics are a bureaucratic hallucination. This episode exposes how drug use data only captures those without resources - the wealthy stay invisible to police, ERs, and treatment centers. When the sensors only see poverty, the numbers lie. AI might be the bureaucracy buster we need to see past the garbage stats.

Key Topics:
- How Adderall vs meth statistics reveal class bias in data collection
- The invisible wealthy drug user: concierge doctors and private dealers
- Police, treatment centers, and pharma: three pillars with no incentive for honest data
- Why official statistics are maps of poverty, not reality
- AI as a potential tool to bypass bureaucratic data blindspots
