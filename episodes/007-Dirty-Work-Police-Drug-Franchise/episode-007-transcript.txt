Welcome back to the deep dive. Today we're gonna do something a little different, yeah, a little bit usually, you know, we take a stack of articles or a new book, we break it all down, yeah? But today I'm staring at a single document, just one, just one. It's a transcript of an interview, and honestly, it reads less like a report and more like like a bar thriller that just happens to be real life, looking at a piece of source material titled shadows of justice. And I think the first thing we have to tell you the listener. is, buckle up. Yeah. This isn't some published government study. It's not a press release from our police department with all the right buzz words. This is a raw blood filter, first person account from someone who has been well through the ringer of the justice system. Yeah. Ringer is putting it lightly. We're talking about a source who has lived on the border, lived in the suburbs, and seems to have collided with law enforcement in every single zip code and the picture they paint, it's not the one you see on TV, right? It's not law and order, not at all. It's angry, it's terrified, and it makes some massive allegations about how safety is actually manufactured in this country, precisely. And our mission today is to really unpack those allegations. We aren't here to say this is definitively true in every single precinct in America, of course not. But we are here to explore the sources lived experience and the theories they built from it. We're going to look at what they call the dirty work of border policing, the blue wall of silence, and how a simple traffic ticket can destroy a life just as effectively as a prison sentence. It's a journey. So we've got a lot to cover. We're going to start in El Paso with a mystery that honestly keeps bothering me. Then we're going to look at the culture inside police departments, the corruption, the Brotherhood, as the source calls it, and we've got two very specific, very harrowing case studies you really are, one involving a mental health. crisis, and another involving a very suspicious drug dust in Plano, of all places. And then, because we like to go big, we're going to zoom out to the sources grand theory about the police state and well, global control. It is a journey, micro, a single traffic stop, to the macro, geopolitical warfare. But it all starts with a map, right? The check lesson, yeah.

So let's start with the hook. The source opens with this question that, on the surface seems pretty simple. They're looking at El Paso, Texas. Now, for people who haven't been there, El Paso is right over. You can throw a rock and hit Mexico. It's not an exaggeration. The cities of El Paso and Juarez are for all intents and purposes, one metropolitan area separated by a river and fence and historically and statistically, El Paso is it's an anomaly. It's a huge anomaly. If you look at the FBI crime data, if you look at safety rankings from various think tanks, El Paso is consistently one of the safest cities in the United States for a size. You mean for any size, really, we're talking about incredibly low homicide rates, low violent crime. It is safer than many cities deep in the Midwest that are nowhere near an international border. Good job. El Paso. Thumbs up.

But here is the catch, and this is the paradox source obsesses over. It's the whole reason for the question, exactly, if you look south, literally, across the fence, yes, who died Juarez, and the situation in Juarez, particularly during the times the source is discussing, is, I mean, it's the. the polar opposite. It's often described as a war, not just by our source, by, you know, international journalists, by department, absolutely. The source mentions daily kidnappings, shootings, 1000s of deaths, talking about cartel violence that at its peak rivaled active military conflict zones in places like Iraq or Afghanistan. So you have these two. They're physically touching. They're part of the same valley. They share air, they share history, they share family connections. But on one side of this you. let's be honest, fairly arbitrary line, it's absolutely chaos, a humanitarian crisis driven by Narco violence. And on the other side, yards away, it's, statistically, one of the safest places you live in America. The source asks, how is that physically possible? It's a really valid question, because normally, violence spills over. That's the nature of violence. It doesn't respect municipal countries, right? It's like water. It flows Exactly. If you have a war happening next door, you expect stray bullets. You expect conflict to bleed across the border, kidnappings, you expect extortion, but in Paso, there's this hard stop, like a firewall.

So the answer, the one you'd hear on the news politician, is that we have a wall. We have the Border Patrol. We have great policing, the official line, the official Yeah, but the source, they don't buy that for. for a second. No, they don't. They argue that a wall, a fence, doesn't stop the kind of money and power that the cartels wheel. A cartel that can build a submarine, sophisticated tunnel isn't going to be stopped by a chain link. So the source produces a much darker hypothesis. They call it the dirty work theory. Dirty work, it sounds and it is. What exactly are they implying here? Source says, and I'm quoting here, the real reason, because police took care of the dirty work. The implication is that El Paso isn't safe because the police are following the law and arresting bad guys, in a conventional sense, not because of good community policing and. after school program safe because the police or or actor working in tandem with them are operating outside the law to keep the violence out.

Let's pause on that, because that is a huge claim. They are basically saying that city clean and safe for the average person. The authorities have to get their hands very dirty. They're talking about extra judicial enforcement. Exactly. It's concept of invisible violence. The theory goes something like this, for the average tourist or resident to feel safe, for the city to have that glossy broker ready reputation, there has to be a mechanism that absolutely terrifies the criminal element into staying on their line. More terrifying than seeking to jail much more. And that mechanism can't be a court of law because courts have rules, due process, appeals lawyers suggesting that the piece is maintained, shadowy force doesn't worry about Miranda rights, a force that speaks the same language of violence as the cartels.

Now, know what a skeptical listener is thinking. This sounds like conspiracy theory. Maybe the Border Patrol is just really, really efficient, and that's a fair reaction. But the source doesn't just pull this out of thin air. They tell the story about a friend of theirs in El Paso. It's not me cold when I read it the mask. Yeah. So set the scene first. This isn't a drug dealer, friend or a gang member. This is you migrants, correct? So she is doing what she sees as humanitarian work. She has people in her home who have crossed the border, probably seeking asylum, and according to the source, her door gets and this is where the details get really specific and strange. It's not one guy. It's not a burglar trying to be No, the source describes 10 men, all wearing masks. Don't just break in. They form a tactical entry. They punch her out, which implies a very clinical, brutal application, of course, not a scuffle. They did just it was a message, a message, they interrogate her and leave, just vanish.

Now, my first thought, and I think everyone's first thought, is, that's the car, right? You're on the border. You're dealing with migrants, which can sometimes be tangled up with smugglers. 10 guys in masks show up. That has to be the gang. That's the most logical assumption. The source deems that assumption with a really interesting, cynical economic argument. They compare the cartel to Coca Cola businesses. It sounds funny, but deadly serious point. The source argues that cartels at their core are logistics companies. Their goal is to move product north and move money, sell with as little friction as possible. And violence, especially high profile violence, against American citizen, American soil, that's a lot of friction. It's terrible business if the simple cartel sends a 10 man hit squad to beat up an American woman in her El Paso home. That brings a that brings the FBI, the CNN, Fox News. Everybody descends on the city. It shuts down the smuggling route.

On Investment, unnecessary contrast as the source. They want to be invisible to us, law enforcement, so the source asks the question, if it wasn't the cartel because it was business censored, who is left, who else has that capability? Who has tactical care, who has the manpower, who has the coordination to hit a house with 10 men subdue a target and melt away without a trace, and crucially, who. who the motive to scare someone housing migrants? Implication is state actor, police, maybe a specialized Task Force, but definitely the good guys acting like the bad guys. The dirty work. In practice, it was a message liver off the books. Stop doing or else, and wasn't an official. There's no paper trail. You can't file an FOIA request for beating by masked men. Terrifying, because if it's the police or people protected by the police, who do you call? You can't one one on the people who just kicked your door in. You have no recourse. And that creates a very specific kind of psychological pressure. It leads to the paranormal.

The source describes later in the interview. They talk about surveillance, about feeling watched, damning thing. This felt very sci fi, but very lonely and isolating. The Source described their cell phone just dying, but only specific times between 1.0 AM, or am ever the witch hammer. You're alone your house, you're already because of what your friend every single night at the exact same time, connection to the outside world is severed. You can't call out. No one can call in, describes, going through all the logical steps, buying new buttons, switching carriers, moving the phone to different rooms, same result every night. The signal just dropped. Now, whether this was a targeted cell phone or something else, a technical glitch, the interpretation is what matters here, the source felt like they were in a panopticon. They felt watched by an entity that had superior technology debate a friend in the transcript, right? Yeah, the friend says, maybe it's a neighbor with cheap jammer from the internet and the source? No, this is too precise. This fuel this feels like government. It reinforces the US versus mentality. But them isn't the criminals. Them is the infrastructure. It's the feeling that the state itself is tighten use around you, watching you, controlling your ability to even communicate.

Which brings to the people who operate that infrastructure. Talk about the police culture, because if this dirty work is happening, people willing to do it, and maybe more importantly, people will the other way. This is where we get into the wall of silence. Now this is a term we hear a lot, yeah, the source breaks down in a way that feel less like a code of honor, like, well, like a criminal conspiracy with a pretty standard admission, something most agree with. Every department has crooked cops, right? No one denies that there are bad apples every profession, but then they fit to the so called good cops. And this argument gets really sharp. The source are that the good cop is a myth, not because individual officers are nice people who coach Little League, because the structure of the Brotherhood, as they call it, forces them to be complicit. They say the real issue is the good cops who cover for them.

Think about the mechanics for a second. If you are a lead officer or fresh out of the academy, and you see your partner, your field training officer, plant evidence on a suspect, what do you do? You have a choice. You can report him and your career. You'll be labeled a rat. No one will want to ride with you. Your life could be in danger during a critical incident, or you say nothing. You say nothing, and in that moment, by saying nothing, you have become part of the corruption. You are an accessory after fact, the blue wall isn't built by bad cops. It's maintained by the silence the good ones. And the source says there is literally nobody watching.

What about internal affairs? Isn't that entire job to police? The police, the source dismisses Internal Affairs entirely. Call them bubbles within everything. A bubble, really good image. It implies they're self contained. They're fake. You can't see and they don't let information out. The investigators are cops, the supervisors cops, the chief is a cop. It's all internal. COP is investigating a cop. Who are they more loyal the citizen, complainant or their fellow office? The source, it's always the officer. Police are policing themselves. The Source argues, then there is no real audit. It's a closed loop, and we have a closed loop with no external site. That is when you get the really extreme forms of crush.

And this leads to arguably the most explosive theory in the whole transcript, cycling theory. Yes, this is a heavy one. So we all see the press conference local news, the sheriff stands behind a table loaded with bricks and bags. A week, we see $50 million worth of drugs. Today, everyone claps a victory in the word drugs, but the source asks a simple, cynical question, where does that stuff go? The official answer, of course, it is catalog stored in an evidence locker and eventually transport it to an incinerator and destroyed. There's custody. It's very procedural. But the source theory, based on this view of the Brotherhood and the total lack of oversight, is that a significant portion of it doesn't get destroyed, they believe, sold back onto the street. They call it a franchise. The franchise model, it's a terrifying economic theory. The idea is that the police sees the product from their petition, the cartels, the local dealers, and then they or their informants, put it back market.

Why? What's the motive to fund their own off books? Operations, the source them, jungle operations, which goes right back to work exactly if you fund that squad of 10 masks we talked about earlier, you can't exactly illegal being intimidation on the city budget. You need black money, untraceable cash, the source suggests that the seized drugs provide that black so they become the thing they're supposed to be fighting. They become the top predator in the ecosystem. Control the flow and comparison as hell, they compare these two pharmaceutical companies say there is absolutely no difference, which is, it's a shocking statement. Logic is that both want to sell a product. Medical Company, the cartel has product, and the police, this theory, act as the gatekeepers who profit from flow of illicit goods. When says the government had a little kids eating a population market.

So in this worldview, they're regulators of a market. They secretly aren't stopping the flow. They're monetizing. It creates a moral equivalence that is really hard shake once a year. If the cost dealer are profiting from the same brick of cocaine, then just just, it's just costume, the different kind of game. And if you believe that, if you believe this is that rotten inside out, imagine. Phrase they use is sticks with you, the devil in their eyes. That struck me too, not anger, Alliance, not frustration level. It suggests a level of malice, enjoyment in the violence goes beyond just bad dreams or a stressful situation. Describes being physically to the neck, which, as we all know so many high profile cases, is a potential lethal maneuver. It's not de escalation, it's a move designed to completely subjugate someone. And then there was a chase.

And finally, this is the part, like a violation of space source claims. completely shatters the idea of sanctuary if you can't be safe from the place. in a hospital, can you possibly safe? And your question every screaming right now, sue them by complaint fire. This is an open shut it's the rational, logical response, but the source explains that is a trap. Call it the trap, and it's one of the most insidious mechanisms they walk us through this I've just been beaten up by the police. I have loses, maybe broken bones. I want justice. What happens when I try to Okay? Well, step one to file a formal complaint against an officer, you usually have to go to the police station, the same building where my attacker. exactly. You have to walk into the headers of the brother that just assaulted you, surrounded by people in the same year, and ask reform he's gonna go down to the police department out of their ass kicked. The source says, yeah, the intimidation factor starts walking into the line, then to complain about one of the line, let's say you are let's say you do it. You walk in there, fill up paperwork.

Source mentions a legal hurdle acts as a final firewall. This part is crucial. They claim there is a rule, or at least a threat, that is commonly used by the. that if you file a four complaint and can approve the abuse without a reasonable debt, you the victim can be charged felony, charged with a felony for what, for a full space report. So around on you a complete imagine scenario in your word, three officers, they will all say, violent. You're resisting. You are body camp, mysteriously function. The police can then go to the DA and say, This person is lying, get us in trouble. That crime, charge them. So the risk is like risk is I go to for trying to precisely it raises the state so high no one is to take that bet, and that is why, as the source point out, the department stand up at a city council meeting and claim to have a spotless record. We had zero complaints of excessive forces, right? Because you terrified everyone who wanted one into cells. It's a statistical supply that is maintained by systemic validation.

So that's the physical violence, and the system protects it. The second case, this one is different about procedural violence, the violence of paperwork and the court system. And it's in Plano, Texas. We're leaving border town or in the affluent suburbs of Dallas, manicure grounds, homeowners associations, strip malls, a place that feels safe. The Source just a kid, 17 years old, and honestly, the wholesome at all refurbishing old furniture, yard sales, it's the American dream, a little small business partnership, hustle. They're drawing an alleyway with Brother picking up a big old rear rejection TV. You remember those things? They made a ton absolute money. You needed a dolly. So they're wrestling this TV into a vehicle on their own business. And so ambush, the source describes it like a military operation. Not just one. Are pulling up two squad cards from left, two from the right, and SUV blocks out of the alley, five police vehicles for two teenagers in a television the show of voice is completely disproportionate to the situation and the pretext, the official reason for this massive tactical response just It's laughable, a jay walking warrant laughs dryly, a jay walking warrant for the brother.

Now, let's be real. Police departments do not deploy five units, including an SUV for a Class C misdemeanor that carries a fine of maybe 50 bucks. No, it was a fishing expedition. You're looking for something, the yield is an excuse to stop and search and when they find anything. Well, this story goes from local. He just holds it up and says it's meth. Hold on, analyze the property, because this is so strange. I've studied police procedure. I've countless hours body cam footage. Know what drug does look like my bag, either foil pipes or surgery. If they test the subs, they use a special kit. There's a little pouch, a glass file of chemicals, you know. See a glass file of chemicals you don't want an open glass dish of liquid chemicals in your pocket, if it's over your leg, physically, it makes no sense. Petri dish belongs in a sterile not a tactical test. The source claim is that this evidence was prepared for him, planted at the scene. Source says there were no baggies in the car. There was no search of anything. This officer appears with the dish and says, Here's the evidence. It feels like a bad magic trick, but the horror is that the magic trick worked. The source was arrested.

Source was arrested, and this brings what the source calls the buffaloing that's the term for the judicial process that follows buffaloing. And statistic of fallen county is 98% conviction rate. Just dwell on that number, 98% any human system. 98 efficiency is basically impossible if a car's 98 of the time, be a miracle. If a court system fix 90% of the people charges, it means the system is not determining innocence. It means the system is rigged. It means there is no real presumption of innocence. Source argued that this impossibly high rate Is a cheap bullying by it's the plea deal machine. It's coercion. Imagine you are that 17 year old kid holding so you know you are innocent. Your court, my public defender, who has maybe to look at your case, comes and says, kid, look the stats. If we go to trial, you have a 98% chance of losing the jury. Will the cop not and if you lose the judge 20 years an example. But if you please give right now, sir, charge your probation. Can go home tired adult, like 2% of a jury, a teenager or police officer or you take the probation, the felony record that will follow you from you take, almost everyone takes the deal. That's how they get to 90% it's not about justice. It's about processing bodies in the system, assembly line of convictions once you take, once you are in the system, fall into the trap.

And this episode shifts. Stop talking about violence and drug stuff, and we start talking about the slow, crashing, weight, poor, second five, the poverty. sheen it's in imagine you. This is the part with the nurse, because you don't need to be criminal caught on this. You just need to be broke. It starts with incredible tail light, five month expired registration sticker for say, $200 you're living paycheck to paycheck. Rent is due by grocery so you don't think I'll deal with it later. Your fines will warrant and your driver's license, so now you can't drive legally. But here is the catch 22 you still have a job. You still have to pay rent, and in most of America, especially in a sprawling place like Texas, public transit is a joke. You cannot get to work without a car.

The Source breaks down the math of the Uber alternative, because people who have never been in this situation always well, just take an Uber if you lost our license. Right? Let's do the math on that. Say you make $15 an hour, which is more than minimum wage. An Uber to your job at the warehouse across town might cost $30 and an Uber home at the end of your shift costs another $30 that is $60 a day just for transportation. That is four hours your labor gone, you can pay for food or rent or anything else. You're working half your eight hour shift just to pay for the privilege of showing up. It is mathematically impossible to survive on that you can't feed your family on what's left. So what is the rational economic choice? The rational choice is to get in your car, start the engine, and pray you don't get pulled over. You are forced to break the law.

Just the police know this. They have automated license plate scanners that ping on suspended licenses. They know who is suspended so you get pulled over again, and now it's not just another ticket. Driving while suspended is often a Class B misdemeanor. It's an arrestable offense. Your car gets towed, which is a few $100 have, and the source talks about a three strikes dynamic, yeah, you get caught doing this a few times, and you aren't just looking at fines anymore. You are looking at mandatory jail time. You've gone from a broken taillight to a jail cell, and you never actually hurt anyone, never stole anything. Your only crime was being poor.

Source calls this extraction, and I think that is the absolute perfect word for it. It implies mining, taking resources from exactly the police force in this model isn't acting as a safety organization. They're acting as a new collection for the city and county, they're mining the poor for fees, fines, court costs and Bill money. It is a massive transfer of wealth from citizens to the state. And there is a political side effect to all this, which might be the most important part disenfranchisement. This is crucial. The source says this system takes away their ability to vote in new people. Once you have that felony, once you get hit with the drug charge from the fake petri dish, or you get a felony charge for being a repeat offender, for driving while suspended. In many states, you lose your right to vote, sometimes for years, sometimes forever. It cements the power structure in place.

Think about it as a it as a feedback the people who are most abused by the system, the poor, the minorities targeted by pretty work are systematically stripped of their political voice. They cannot vote out the sheriff who oversees the department. They cannot vote for a new district attorney who might change the plea bargaining policies. The system insulates itself from change by criminal critics and its victims. It's a closed loop of control, and honestly, it makes you feel clause just hearing it described, but the source, they aren't done this idea of a closed loop, and they zoom way, way out.

Yes, we are county limits. Now we are going global. This is the macro view. This is the grand unified theory. The source has a theory about what they call the arco, terrorist police state. They look at the US and Mexico, and they see mirrors of each other. They compare the situation to Venezuela. They describe a state where the leadership installs its own police apparatus specifically to control the population, not to serve it. Call Mexico a narturist, which we discussed in the intro, is a fair argument to make. But then they pivot to who is pulling the strings behind the cartels. This was the curve ball for me. They point the finger at China. This reflects a very modern, very palpable anxiety about foreign influence, crisis devastating American communities and geopolitics.

They argue that, because China is the primary source for the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, which is a documented fact, they are effectively running the narco state from afar. It's a supply chain war. The source sees the drugs, not just as a product for profit, but as a chemical weapon. They argue that China is supplying the ammunition, the fentanyl precursors, that is destroying American communities from the inside out. And they connect this to sovereignty, to who owns the country. They talk about land ownership. The source claims China owns land the size of the Ozarks in Missouri. Now whether that specific, realistic stat is 100% accurate is almost beside the point. It's about the feeling of being conquered, the feeling of losing control of your own country.

The source sees a pincer movement. On one side, you have foreign powers buying up the land and poisoning the people with drugs. On the other side, you have a domestic lease force that is corrupt, that extracts or and protects its blue wall. It's the feeling of encirclement. You aren't safe from the outside forces, and you aren't safe from the internal forces that are supposed to protect you. You're trapped.

And that leads to their definition of the war. This is my favorite insight from the whole text. I think they say the war isn't on a battlefield. It's in a room. War is in a room. For us, what does that mean? It completely changes the definition of conflict. We usually think of war as soldiers in uniform shooting at each other in a field, but the source is saying that the real war the 21st Century war, to destroy lives, the decision to prioritize low level drug busts over solving violent crimes, the decision to fund the city budget through traffic tickets, the decision to allow fentanyl precursors to flow into the Country. Those decisions happen in quiet, air conditioned rooms. It's a war managed by people, by politicians, by lobbyists, by corporate executives, exactly, and the police on the street, the ones with the petri dishes and the masks. In this view, they are just the foot soldiers. They're the managers of the population. Their job is to keep us in line, to enforce the policies decided on in that room, while the real power players make the deals.

It's a heavy, heavy worldview. It strips away any solution that the system is just the system is working was designed to and that brings us to the end of the sources testimony we have traveled a long, long way in this deep dive. We started with a simple question, a paradox in El Paso, why is it safe? Answer, dirty work. We decide this to Trump's law. We looked at the drug or dies. We sat with the mother in the middle of a mental health crisis, watching the devil in the officer's eyes. We sat with the kid in that alley in Plano being framed with a fake petri dish. We crunched the numbers trap and saw law itself, can people to become criminals just to survive. And finally, we saw the global picture, a nation hollowed out by death, by drugs and on by a police state that, according to this source, answers to no one.

It is a bleak picture. But deep dives aren't always about happy endings. They are about seeing the machinery. And now we and you see the machine described by the source. You can't unsee it before we go though, there was one last thing, a final provocation from the source. It was almost a throwaway line. Flagged it in your notes, and I think it's the perfect place to end, yes, the AI comment, the source mentioned just in passing that your cartel members are having as much cash as they can right now. Why? Because they are terrified of artificial intelligence. They believe that AI powered surveillance, facial recognition, transaction monitoring. It's going to make business too hard. It will become impossible. Hide from an all seeing algorithm, but let's flip that coin. If a crime impossible, what is the digital state we just were describing? That is the chilling question. If the petri dish becomes a digital fabrication that is mathematically perfect, impossible to disprove, if the jury be done by algorithms that track your every move and predict your dissent before you even act, spotless record is maintained, not by intimidation, but by code that automatically deletes inconvenient data, then we are entering a new era.

If the system of control becomes automated, descent itself might become mathematically impossible. The shadows of justice might not be cast by men in masks anymore. Might be servers in a data center. Unlike the men in masks, you can't punch back at a server. You can't even see it well. On that terrifying note, laughs nervously. I think we need to wrap up. This has been a heavy one, but a really important one. We try to honor the sources raw experience while connecting it to these bigger systems. It's a reminder that safety and justice are two different words, and some according to the source, one is the enemy of the other. Something to think about the next time you see those red and blue lights in your rear view mirror. Thanks for listening. Deep Dive, stay curious, stay critical, and we'll catch you on the next one you.
