Episode 001: Cultivating Intelligence - The Bonsai Analogy and The Future of AI

SUMMARY:
A deep exploration of local AI infrastructure, philosophical frameworks for understanding artificial intelligence, and the power of creative collaboration. This episode unpacks the strategic advantage of running 200 billion parameter models locally on DGX Spark hardware, the privacy-first mandate for high-stakes intelligence analysis, and introduces the Bonsai analogy - viewing AI fine-tuning as cultivating a living, responsive entity rather than programming a machine.

KEY TOPICS:
- DGX Spark setup for local 200B parameter model processing
- Privacy-first AI: Attorney-client privilege and operational security
- Fine-tuning techniques (LoRA adapters) for proprietary intelligence
- The Bonsai analogy: AI as cultivated living intelligence
- Physics of computation: E=mc2, Landauer's principle, and the material cost of intelligence
- Intelligence as a spectrum - beyond the binary view of consciousness
- The value of conceptual collaboration and non-linear thinking
- Scaling childhood creativity into professional innovation
