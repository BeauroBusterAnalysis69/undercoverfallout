Episode 001: Think Tank Paralysis - Trillion Dollar Agents and Broken Policy

SUMMARY:
A deep dive into the overwhelming pace of AI development and three critical paradoxes shaping our technological future. We explore Anthropic's Claude "computer use" API - a trillion-dollar capability that lets AI operate your desktop like a human, clicking, typing, and navigating any software through screenshots alone.

KEY TOPICS:
- AI Overload: The "AI paralysis" phenomenon where technological advancement outpaces human comprehension
- The Value Paradox: How AI agents dissolve the value of standalone tools, forcing brutal consolidation into platform ecosystems
- The Trust Paradox: Why hardware-level privacy constraints (like "myopic cameras") beat software settings for building user trust
- The Policy Paradox: Balancing surveillance capability for serious crimes against personal liberty - examining Singapore's control model vs Portugal's decriminalization experiment

THEMES:
The episode synthesizes tech capability, business consolidation, and policy governance into a unified framework for understanding AI's societal impact. It argues that competent governance requires holding seemingly contradictory positions: privacy for low-harm activities, surveillance capability for high-harm crimes.
