# UNDERCOVER FALLOUT

**Where Truth Meets Fiction in the Digital Bunker**

A satirical, personality-driven show and website exploring big tech, geopolitics, and recovery in the digital age through the persona of KC Ryback—powered by AI and fueled by chaos.

## 🎯 What is This?

**Undercover Fallout** is:
- **Half serious** - Real geopolitical analysis meets speculative fiction
- **Half satire** - When reality is stranger than fiction, sometimes you just have to laugh
- **Fully human** - With AI sidekicks (NotebookLM does the heavy lifting)

Think Rush Limbaugh meets postmodern AI culture. A digital bunker where conspiracy theory meets cultural commentary, and nobody gets out clean.

## 📻 The Format

### Episodes (15-20 minutes)
AI-generated audio deep dives powered by **Google's NotebookLM**. I feed it analysis, theories, and hot takes. NotebookLM narrates them like a conspiracy podcast meets investigative journalism.

### Commentary Feed
Written posts covering everything the audio can't. Raw thoughts. Cultural riffs. Geopolitical speculation. Real talk about recovery, tech, and the absurdity of modern life.

## 🎭 The Origin Story

The name "Fallout" isn't just branding—it's personal. In 2024, I lost everything to fraudsters. Met with the FBI. Thought the DEA was next. Feared the CIA was coming. I was on drugs. Lost a friend. It was a real-life fallout.

So I'm processing it the only way I know how: by turning trauma into art, conspiracy into commentary, and chaos into content. This is my bunker. Welcome.
